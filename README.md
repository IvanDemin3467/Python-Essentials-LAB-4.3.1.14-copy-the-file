# Python-Essentials-LAB-4.3.1.14-copy-the-file
Now you're going to amalgamate all this new knowledge, add some fresh elements to it, and use it to write a real code which is able to actually copy a file's contents.

Of course, the purpose is not to make a better replacement for commands like copy (MS Windows) or cp (Unix/Linux) but to see one possible way of creating a working tool, even if nobody wants to use it.

**Complete code includes**

```
# ask the user for the name of the file to copy
# repeat nearly the same action, but this time for the output file
# prepare a piece of memory for transferring data from the source file to the target one;
# write the buffer's contents to the output file 
# some final cleaning - the job is done
```
